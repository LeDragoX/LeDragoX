**If you like any of my projects, you can support me through here. I generally like making scripts that automatizes challenging stuff.**

## ðŸ˜‰ About Me

Hello, i am ~~THE STORM THAT IS...~~ PlÃ­nio Larrubia, i love messing with PCs, _wannabe_ enthusiast (_kinda, i don't do overclocking_), i like hacking stuff to get the extra performance a _hardware + system_ can give to a device. I also love to automatize all the configuration parts (if possible), i'm giving a shot on **Web Applications**, so i can improve over these areas either.

## ðŸ’¡ My Projects

### ~ [Win Debloat Tools](https://github.com/LeDragoX/Win-Debloat-Tools)

My variety of scripts to optimize and configure _Windows_ as i would like... **DEBLOATED**. This project includes automatic daily upgrade of Softwares found on package managers, fine-tuning for certain aspects of the system and possibility to customize some tweaks through graphical interface. You can also install multiple Softwares with a few clicks, silently and with a wide gamma of possibilities.

### ~ [Linux Script](https://github.com/LeDragoX/linux-script)

My bash scripts that setup a workflow for me after installing linux, install **applications** which i may use on a daily drive, configure **Grub**, install and setup **ZSH + Oh My Zsh**, install **nvm**, **rvm**, **asdf** version managers. When using a desktop install **graphics driver** if necessary, anyway, this was meant for me to share my linux workflow and tools with other people, adjust according to your need.

### ~ [AIO Android Debloater](https://github.com/LeDragoX/aio-android-debloater)

A Shell script that relies on `adb` to uninstall bloatware from Android without the need of using a **ROOTED** phone.

âš  **ATTENTION**: this project is unmaintained as i'm using Custom ROMS and don't depend on manufacturer's OSes anymore, this isn't receiving any support, but still valid for old phones.
